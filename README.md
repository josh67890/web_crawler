# web_crawler
a simple web crawler that downloads and saves on your machine images from the web, to a depth specified by user.

to run, simply run the script from the cli with the following command:
py "program filename" "full root url to be scanned" "integer number of depth level to be crawled"

you will be prompted to specify your preferred parent directory for storing the images downloaded in - you can skip this part and the default will use your current working directory.
